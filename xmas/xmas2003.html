<p>We thought that we were going to take it easy in 2003 but things
didn't quite work out like that...  Mostly this year we've been going
to Cornwall (6 times!).</p>

<p>Firstly some very important news - we have a new family member (see
the exact centre of the picture) - Clifford (the large black and white
rabbit) for Amy's 7th birthday.  Amy has been learning to feed her
rabbit every day and amazingly Holly (left hand side 1/3 of the way
up) hasn't eaten him yet.</p>

<p>The school holiday over the summer was spent mostly at home (top
centre).  We enjoyed a brief stay with friends in France, visiting the
beach on the hottest day and the site of the battle of Agincourt (can
you spot the naked knight in the picture?).</p>

<p>In August we went away to Cornwall for 2 weeks.  The first week we
spent in Loveday's mother's newly converted barn and the second in a
friend's cottage in Port Isaac.  We had a very busy holiday seeing
family (see children 'surfing' in Nick's mother's stream just above
centre) and friends!  The highlight was our fishing trip in
"Winnie-the-Pooh" (see top right picture of Port Isaac) - we caught 5
mackerel, cooked and ate them!  You'll also see Loveday, Amy and Ed on
the beach in their wet suits just about to go surfing (brave things!).</p>

<p>Other things that have happened this year: Trees felled in the garden
to make it lighter. Plumbing renovated (nice and warn for
Christmas!). Burglary (burglar caught and most things returned) and
subsequent burglar alarm (required by house insurance).  Camping trip
to a friend's wood in October (cold but fun - see bottom middle and
top 2nd left).  Trip to Hollycombe steam fair (bottom right). Helping
Nick's step-mother Val to move.</p>

<p>Isabel has grown from a beguiling baby to a talkative toddler! She has
enchanted us with her smile whilst causing grievous wreckage with her
hand behind her back!</p>

<p>Edmund has started school proper now - he is in Year 1!  He is
learning to read very well and his writing is improving too!  Ed has
become obsessed with Lego this year creating huge structures in which
he enacts his adventures.</p>

<p>Amy started a new school (Holy Trinity) this year and is settling in
just fine.  She is now a Brownie (you can see her in the picture in
her uniform).  Even more of her teeth have fallen out since the
picture last year!</p>

<p>Next year we are hoping to make some more headway into our plans for
the house.  Hopefully time and funds permitting it will be the year of
the kitchen - let you know next year!</p>
