<p>Highlights of 2012 included skiing in Arosa in March where Dougal proved fearless on the ski slopes using his “go as fast as possible, crash and carry on” technique (see if you can find him in his ski gear).  Easter saw us narrow boating on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Union_Canal">Grand Union Canal</a> in the Midlands with old friends.  The weather (as with most of the year) left a lot to be desired! Trips included the science museum (Isabel with CO<sub>2</sub> bubble), “War Horse” and a late night visit to the David Hockney exhibition.</p>

<p>In June some chicks hatched in Dougal's classroom and then came to live with us. The chickens entertained us (and the fox) pecking round the garden - maybe we will get more next year.  We shared the Olympic experience with friends and family in Cornwall. The best holiday weather was in September when we spent a weekend glamping (posh camping). We stayed in a canvas tent, with beds, indoor plumbing and a stove!  See the family toasting marshmallows and the amazing wood burning hot tub.  October found us in the Lake District; you can spot us rowing on Derwent Water if you look closely.</p>

<p>Amy (16) successfully battled with her GCSEs, particularly enjoying photography. She has now moved school to be with her pony for the 6<sup>th</sup> form.  She is settling well and is now embroiled with science and maths A-level modules. She spent a lot of time training for the pony club musical ride (synchronised horse riding to music) performed at the Surrey County Show in June. You can see her and Toffee in their Jubilee outfits.</p>

<p>Ed (15) has had another year of ups and downs. He has enjoyed surfing, snowboarding, <a href="http://www.guilfest.co.uk">Guilfest</a> and helping organise the annual meeting for young Quakers in Britain. Unfortunately he also... ! He is now settling in well at his new school. High fiving the ceiling caused his only fracture. Ed spends many happy hours shouting at his friends via Skype whilst playing <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>.</p>

<p>Isabel (11) went on a soggy Jubilee Guide camp and has been enjoying Art, having friends over, reading books on her new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Kindle</a> and spending as much time as possible in her pyjamas.  She is currently revising for entrance exams in January. Her new hamster “Ginger Snap” is keeping her company. Hopefully the dog won't eat this one!</p>

<p>Dougal (5) and school seem to have got the hang of each other now. He's still obsessed with Lego, Star Wars, Harry Potter, filling his school shoes up with water and getting cross with computer games.</p>

<p>Nick hasn't had much time for hobbies this year, but he started painting a portrait of Loveday and entered the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/">International Obfuscated C Contest</a>. A rapidly growing <a href="http://www.memset.com/">Memset</a> has kept him out of trouble otherwise. Loveday relished her first ever surfing lesson on Christmas Eve (see picture with Ed). She had a special birthday treat at the “<a href="http://www.thefatduck.co.uk/">Fat Duck</a>” (see yummy green snail porridge), enjoys her book groups and helps out at Dougal's school.</p>

<p>Here's hoping for better weather in 2013.</p>
