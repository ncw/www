<p>We had a excellent opening to 2011 with New Year in Cornwall (see <a href="http://youtu.be/ogCJ7tZLX2I">Treharrock New Year on YouTube</a> for Amy's  video). Other highlights early in the year include, Isabel skiing with Nick, bravely taking Ed's place after he broke his leg; trips to <a href="http://www.cadburyworld.co.uk">Cadbury World</a> and Legoland (quite overwhelming for a small Lego enthusiast); a wonderfully sunny week in Port Merion; Easter at Wind's Point with Loveday's family (see N&amp;L top left with Malvern Hills) and fossil hunting in Lyme Regis in May.</p>

<p>In the summer we spent a week at Canterbury University for “<a href="http://www.quaker.org.uk/ymg">Yearly Meeting Gathering</a>” which is the annual get together for British Quakers for fun (“Gathering”) and the business of organising themselves (“Yearly Meeting”).  There was a huge range of activities for all ages and we all got something out of it.  Amazingly Ed was nominated to help organise the youth activities of the next one, a good learning experience, just not sure whether for Ed or them yet!  At the end of the summer we had a splendid trip to Turkey for a fortnight of water sports (see windsurfing picture) and a bit of culture (Amy and Nick at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus">Ephesus</a>).  We were back in Cornwall in October for Tris and Tam's 40<sup>th</sup> and Elizabeth's 70<sup>th</sup> birthdays.</p>

<p>Amy (15) has had a full year with GCSE coursework, Bronze Duke of Edinburgh award, <a href="http://www.pcuk.org/index.php/tests_and_achievements/efficiency_tests/c_standard/">“C” test on Toffee</a> and Pony Club camp.  The pinnacle of the horse season was a surprise win in a “Horse and Hound” competition with Nick jumping a clear round with Daisy and Amy doing the same with Toffee!</p>

<p>Ed (14) has grown to 6 foot, did well in his Common Entrance, has had 4 fractures (left arm, right leg, right arm, left arm), a bone oedema (left leg), 34 medical appointments, dyed his hair purple, was suspended for a week, started senior school and set fire to his dorm! We are hoping for fewer phone calls from school in 2012!</p>

<p>Isabel (10) has been on good form this year. She has enjoyed Brownies, dance, horse riding, seeing her friends, tennis camp, <a href="http://www.yvonne-arnaud.co.uk/youth-theatre/groups-and-classes">play in a week</a>, indoor climbing and boarding 2 nights a week.</p>

<p>Dougal (4) has learnt to ride his bike with steely determination which involved lots of crashing, being pulled out of the bushes and having another go!  We have unleashed him on the local infant school and he has settled in nicely.  He does still climb up things he isn't supposed to but has become less of a menace around the house, probably due to his new Lego obsession.</p>

<p>Nick and Loveday have had a few Art lessons. This has been a revelation: Nick in particular never thought he would be able to do Art, being a dyed-in-the-wool scientist, but the Art teacher has proved otherwise! With 4 children at 4 schools Loveday's life has been chaotic, though she did find time for a few tennis lessons and two book groups.  Nick has had his hands full with the ever expanding <a href="http://www.memset.com/">Memset</a> but has found a bit of time for <a href="/nick/articles/how-i-solved-the-gchq-challenge/">cracking GCHQ's codes</a> amongst other things.</p>

<p>Hope you have an excellent 2012.</p>
