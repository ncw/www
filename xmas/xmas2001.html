<p>Due to unanticipated circumstances (leaves on the line or new baby or
something like that) we've failed to send you all a Christmas
card. However we've sent you this New Year's card instead.  The reason
for this delay is that we had a significant piece of news that we
wanted to be sure of before emitting this missive - we're moving!
More of that later.</p>

<p>First and more importantly we are proud to announce the birth of our
daughter Isabel Verity on 26th November 2001 after a surprisingly easy
delivery.  She weighed in at 7lbs 11oz and has been growing enormously
ever since.  She is currently charming us with her smiles and goos!
You can see pictures of Isabel on the Internet at <a href="http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/isabel">www.craig-wood.com/nick/isabel</a></p>

<p>Edmund has shot up in the last year and is almost as tall as Amy
now. He seems somehow built on a different scale to Isabel - we just
can't believe that 4 years ago we were holding him in our arms!  He is
a very sociable chap and loves having his friends round to play with
his trains.  He is currently obsessed with collecting the entire
Thomas the Tank engine family.</p>

<p>Amy has settled into school much better this year giving us a happy
kiss at the school door and running in.  She still loves being at home
though, drawing lots of pictures, making things and cuddling her
little sister.</p>

<p>Loveday has finished her year studying architecture which she enjoyed
very much but found very hard with two children - a new baby has made
continuing completely impossible for the time being.  Most of
Loveday's time is taken up with looking after Isabel right now -
hopefully the baby will become a little less demanding soon.</p>

<p>Nick has gone back to not having a real job - the software he's been
working on for many years is now doing very well and his company needs
all of his attention now.</p>

<p>The picture on the back of this letter shows the highlights of 2001
for us.  In the top left quadrant there are pictures taken at Felicity
and Grant's wedding.  Middle top are pictures of Isabel and family
(plus the Impish Ed).  Top right is Loveday at South Bank University
and her college work.  Bottom right and middle is our holiday in
Mallorca.  And finally bottom left you'll see our new house (with Amy
the Ballerina and Holly Mad Dog making an unexpected appearance).</p>

<p>Speaking of the new house...  In May we first looked at Fairholme.  It
is located in one of our favourite parts of Guildford - near the river
and near the centre of town - set in 0.3 acre of very private
garden. Its taken a long time and much heartache but now we have
managed to sell our house and buy Fairholme.  In a surprise twist the
current owners of Fairholme are buying our house!  We'll be swapping
houses on the 7th February.</p>
