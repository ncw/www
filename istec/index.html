  </ul>The ISTEC 1008 is an easy to use digital communication system developed especially for small offices, such as tax consultants, lawyers, engineers, self employed,......., and also for the modern home.

  <p>The private exchange provides an economical way to operate analogue terminal equipment on an ISDN S interface. The a/b interfaces enable the operation of any conventional certified terminal equipment such as Group 3 Fax machines, modems, answering machines, and both cordless and other telephones on the ISDN network.</p>

  <p>The ISTEC 1008 detects which dialling mode - DTMF tone or pulse - is used on the a/b interfaces. The system can operate with either EURO-ISDN protocol (DSS1) or the German 1TR6 protocol, and can be used on either an S bus or ISDN PBX line.</p>

  <p>A few of the especially user friendly features are the direct dialling of extensions, selectable service ID for each extension, the easy to use configuration software, and also the rerouting of both internal and external calls.</p>

  <p>The ISTEC 1008 consists of a central unit in a plastic case with 8 a/b interfaces, a standard network connection cable, and an external power supply. The system is ready for use on the ISDN network without any special setting up, in three easy steps: 1, connect the power supply cable: 2, connect the network cable to the ISDN socket: and 3, connect the analogue terminal equipment........</p>
