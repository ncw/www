<p>Things I need to do to the code in order of importance :-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implement save files (really quite important ;-) Needs 2) to be of any use probably</li>
  <li>Implement a worktodo.ini like scheme</li>
  <li>Finish the Wimp front end</li>
  <li>Work out whether the yield function is going to work well enough or whether TaskWindows are needed (not my preferred solution).</li>
  <li>Find out why it is running at 1/2 of the calculated speed (I think that I must be thrashing the TLB in one bit of the code)</li>
  <li>Implement some more FFT sizes (it can only do 2^{6-12,14,16,18} at the moment, 2^15 and 2^17 are desperately needed)</li>
  <li>Work out exactly which exponent fits in which fft size (I can do this approximately at the moment but to do it exactly is difficult).</li>
  <li>Implement Peter Lawrence-Montgomery's signed digit scheme to gain a bit in each digit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rather a lot of work!</p>

<p>Unfortunately I've been very busy with work and home life which has left almost no time for diversions like ARM Prime! Any help would be appreciated.</p>
