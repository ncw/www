title: Technology changes in 2010
---

Technology that has come and gone from my life in 2010, and new stuff
I've learnt. More than I expected!

These notes are really for me to look back at over the years, but you
might find them interesting.

Old
===

Things gone from my life. Gone but not forgotten :-

-   [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) - finally replaced with
    [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-GB/thunderbird/).
    Mutt is a terminal based email client, just in case you haven't
    heard of it. It works really well for power users, is really
    configurable, but in these days of HTML emails and attachments it
    was no longer keeping up. I loved him - he was a faithful mutt,
    but he had to go. (Actually he is still there at the command line
    ready to go if needed - but keep it under your hat!)
-   [Courier V34
    modem](http://www.google.co.uk/images?q=courier+modem) - years
    overdue, I finally disconnected it and consigned it to the pit of
    oblivion. It used to receive faxes, but I don't think anyone has
    sent one for several years. It also used to run a BBS and an
    Internet node, which was useful at times, but now GPRS/3G/Wifi is
    everywhere I want to go it is no longer needed.
-   [ISDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network) -
    128k of digital goodness just wasn't good enough any more and
    became too expensive. Great in its hey-day with 2 channels, 10
    numbers and a whopping 64k digitial Internet connection. Obsoleted
    by ADSL and
    [VOIP](http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/enterprise).
-   [Nokia
    E90](http://www.nokia.co.uk/find-products/all-phones/nokia-e90-communicator)
    & [Symbian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian_OS) - sorry\...
    we've had good times, but I've found someone else
-   [KDE](http://www.kde.org/) - you worked really well until version
    4 where the bugs and the slowness really kicked in.
-   [Usenet](http://en.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usenet) - This was my first
    hint of online communities on the Internet in 1994. Unfortunately
    the cool kids have moved on, and so, reluctantly, have I!

New
===

New technology :-

-   [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-GB/thunderbird/) -
    for people with complicated email lives the plugin system makes
    life bearable! Here are my top plugins
    -   Nostalgy - adds keyboard shortcuts to save, copy, goto folders
    -   Quickfolders - Put your favourite folders along the top
    -   Copy Sent to Current - copy sent mail to the current folder
        not the Sent folder - makes a new and better way of doing
        email
    -   Display Mail User Agent - snoop on what other people use for
        their mail client
    -   Enigmail - Use PGP to sign/encrypt your emails seamlessly
    -   External Editor - edit emails in your favourite editor (eg
        emacs)
    -   Identity Chooser - If you use multiple identities you need
        this!
    -   Mail Redirect - proper bounce of email (not forward)
-   [IMAP](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/UW_IMAP) -
    makes it easy to migrate your email setup. You can still use it
    with procmail so some things haven't changed ;-) I can use it
    with my Android phone and the excellent
    [K9Mail](https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/).
-   [Blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com) - which makes this (fully
    static) website. It replaces a pile of crufty hand built python
    scripts which did the same thing, just not nearly as well!
-   [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) on the desktop - I finally gave
    in and replaced [Debian](http://http://www.debian.org/) testing
    with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) on my main laptop so I can
    spend less time fixing stuff and more time doing real work! Debian
    still rules on the server though.
-   [VOIP](http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/enterprise) - I've
    signed up with a 100% Voip provider and migrated my 10 telephone
    numbers to them. It went reasonably smoothly! I took the ISDN card
    out of my Asterisk PBX. We've been doing this at work for ages -
    it seemed like time to migrate at home too.
-   [Android](http://www.android.org/) - is Google's new phone
    operating system. It runs on Linux and is mostly open source which
    are big positives in my view. I've been enjoying my Android phone
    greatly and have written a number of applications -
    [Oxo3d](http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/android/oxo3d/) is one.
-   [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/) - well not new actually, I last
    gave Gnome up in about 2005 when I got irritated at no longer
    being able to edit my menus. Unfortunately KDE 4 isn't shaping up
    for me, so it is hello again!

Books
=====

Tech books I've read this year. No python books this year - I think
I've read them all now!

-   [Java in a
    Nutshell](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0596007736/?tag=niccrawoosweb-21)
    (again) programming to write Android programs. I learnt original
    Java ages ago, but is is quite a different experience with generic
    types. Still not my favourite language - reminds me too much of
    C++, but bearable.
-   [Programming In
    Scala](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0981531601/?tag=niccrawoosweb-21) -
    just for fun - maybe I'll use it with Android one day. Scala is
    one of the new breed of languages which runs on the Java VM. Scala
    is a (mostly) functional language created by one of the creators
    of Java itself.
-   [Version Control with
    Git](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0596520123/?tag=niccrawoosweb-21) -
    distributed revision control system. Very clever idea with lots
    and lots of command lines to explore. If it scales to the Linux
    kernel then surely it is good enough for my projects?
-   [BGP: Building Reliable Networks with the Border Gateway
    Protocol](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0596002548/?tag=niccrawoosweb-21) -
    how the Internet really works!
-   [Unlocking Android: A Developer's
    Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1933988673/?tag=niccrawoosweb-21) -
    how to make Android applications
-   [Running
    IPv6](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1590595270/?tag=niccrawoosweb-21) -
    yes it *is* coming - IPv4 addresses are running out very soon.
