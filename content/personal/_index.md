## Who am I?

<img src="small/nick.gif" alt="[Picture of ncw]" width="84" height="78" />

An enigma wrapped up in a mystery? I used to have lots more stuff here
but I got bored of it ;-)

## What do I do?

Currently I'm doing about 17 different things. See below for list of current employers. I also have 4 children and a wife which need lots of attention :-)

## What do I do for fun?

Hack on Go stuff, <a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a> or other
cool stuff like <a href="https://github.com/go-python/gpython/">gpython</a>,
play with the children, read books, walk the dog, mess about with
<a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/2E0WPM">Ham radio</a>. When I have time
(which isn't often) I watch TV.
