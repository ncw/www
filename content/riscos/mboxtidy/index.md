## This is for removing excess baggage from ANT Mailbox files.

If you load a mailbox file into !Edit you will see that in front of
every message is a great pile of headers with lots of meaningless
information in. This is particularly noticeable in the ant-chat
mailing list where typically there are more headers that actual
message text.

What this program does it remove the extraneous headers and create a
new mailbox file. In the case of my archive of the ant-chat list this
made it nearly 50% smaller! This doesn't affect Marcel at all, and if
you weren't in the habit of looking at the headers of e-mails you
won't notice either.
