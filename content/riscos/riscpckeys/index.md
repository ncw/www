A small ditty for those who prefer the old layout Acorn Keyboards,
have a US layout keyboard, or prefer CTRL to be above SHIFT and
CAPSLOCK below. (Who invented the AT style keyboard with CTRL in the
wrong place, and who invented the UK layout version with \ between
SHIFT and Z? A prize for anyone who goes and gives them a lot of
hassle anyway ;-)
