Director is a freeware desktop organiser for RISC OS 3.10 or higher.

Director is a general purpose desktop tool. It allows you to customise
your desktop by creating menus of useful commands and icons to attach
the menus to. Any number of menus or icons can be created and attached
in any order to each other.

Director also allows an alternative and faster view onto files in the
form of directory menus and allows these menus to be attached to other
menus also.

Director has some other useful features such as remembering the most
recently used files, the ability to add key strokes into the keyboard
buffer and the ability to produce directory menus over drive icons.

Director has become an Open Source project and its new home page is
here http://director.sourceforge.net.

Its now excellently maintained by <a

eye on the mailing lists though!
